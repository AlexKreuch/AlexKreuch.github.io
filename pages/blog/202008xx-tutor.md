This blog is about how to install OpenEdx by [Tutor(rpi)](https://github.com/ole-vi/tutor-rpi) on Tor network. Tutor(rpi) is forked from [Tutor](https://github.com/overhangio/tutor) and customized to run on Raspberry pi 4.

[Tutor](https://github.com/overhangio/tutor) is a docker-based [Open edX](https://openedx.org/) distribution, both for production and local development. The goal of Tutor is to make it easy to deploy, customize, upgrade and scale Open edX. Tutor is reliable, fast, extensible, and it is already used by dozens of Open edX platforms around the world.

## Setting up Environment in Raspberry Pi for OpenEdx

1. Delete all Docker containers and Docker images
The default treehouses starts Planet.
They might hinder Tutor from installing OpenEdx, so you should delete them.

1. Get Onion Address
Tutor asks hosting address to host OpenEdx.
Get your Onion Address by `treehouses tor`

Note. If you boot up your image first time, you should reboot it again.
Without rebooting, your stoarage might not be enough to install OpenEdx.
